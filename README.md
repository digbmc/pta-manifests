# PTA Manifests

IIIF presentation manifests for [Paul Thomas Annotated: In the Margins](https://digbmc.github.io/pt-annotated/) deployed with GitHub Pages.

## Documentation

The manifests were generated using Tropy and Tropiiify (see these instructions: [Building a simple IIIF digital library with Tropy, Tropiiify and Canopy](https://literarymachin.es/iiif-tropy-canopy/)). The same process generated level-0 IIIF images, which are served currently at https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/.
