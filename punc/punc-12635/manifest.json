This is followed by a cut to a shot from behind Lena as they begin to kiss, which quickly cuts to them about to kiss from a different angle. In addition to a break in continuity that emphasizes the significance of this kiss, this marks a literal and metaphorical change in perspective as they seal their love with a kiss and the music peaks in both volume and speed.</p><p></p><p>PTA has said that he hopes <i>Punch-Drunk Love</i> is a \"make-out movie\": \"It was meant to be.
