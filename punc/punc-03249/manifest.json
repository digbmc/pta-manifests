The choice contributes to the sense of tension in this long sequence that ramps up after Barry's second phone call with Georgia. It also suggests that some elements of the narrative, namely Barry's passion for Lena, exceed the bounds of the film and push outward into non-diegetic space.</p>"}],"target":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-03249/canvas/1#xywh=164,138,857,801"}]}]}]}
