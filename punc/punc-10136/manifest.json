In the end, his ultimate heterosexual union with Lena—ephemeral, problematic, and partially illusory—reinforces a large cultural logic of capitalism that depends on the promotion and maintenance of a happy, <i>reproductive</i> workforce. The resolution to the love story is not only Lena and Barry’s reconciliation. It also involves the idea that he can redeem the frequent-flyer mileage in order to follow her anywhere the job might take her—reinforcing the unending capitalist ritual of both production (work) and consumption (play)” (Sperb, <i>Blossoms &amp; Blood</i>, 184).</p>"}],"target":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-10136/canvas/1#xywh=94,139,681,803"}]}]}]}
