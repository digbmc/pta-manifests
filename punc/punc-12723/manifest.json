At the beginning of the film, Barry opened one door on the other side of the warehouse, and now the other remains wide open. He is at peace with Lena and the harmonium in his space that is not so lonely anymore. PTA is defensive about the couple's future: \"'No way, Barry's never going to have any problems, any more, for the rest of his life; everything's perfect now, for both of them. I wouldn't wanna see it not work out. I don't like it when it doesn't work out in the movies. I hate that'\" (<i>Independent UK</i>). However, as Jason Sperb suggests, maybe that happy ending is fleeting: \"Believing that Barry and Lena will simply live 'happily ever after' superficially ignores unresolved problems with both of them raised throughout the film\" (Sperb, <i>Blossoms &amp; Blood</i>, 159). As always, it is up to viewers to decide.</p>"}],"target":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-12723/canvas/1#xywh=1013,142,740,800"},{"id":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-12723/canvas/1/f74b2b50-d509-496a-ba74-8a25e7c661bd","type":"Annotation","motivation":"commenting","body":[{"created":"2025-08-27T21:00:46.107Z","creator":"Olivia Flores","purpose":"commenting","type":"TextualBody","format":"text/html","value":"<p>Another blue flare, now mostly on the space that Lena's body occupies in the frame, suggesting her synthesis with Barry.</p>"}],"target":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-12723/canvas/1#xywh=1,544,842,253"}]}]}]}
