Not unlike the scene the beginning of the film in which the truck bursts from the right side of the screen and its noises suddenly come out of nowhere, the dialogue here is introduced all of a sudden. His family continues to talk about the time he broke a glass door with a hammer, causing Barry to become furious beneath the surface, and thus the sound design mirrors this burst of rage that precedes his next attack on a door.</p><p></p><p>The camera slowly pushes in on Barry as he stands between a table and a china cabinet, reflecting his sense of being trapped by his family, the intensity of his emotions after being called \"gay boy\" again embodied by the pressure of the camera getting closer to his body. In this scene, Barry often stands along the vertical axes of the china cabinet, which intersect with the horizontal lines of the shelves. These crosses behind him suggest a certain martyrdom, his sacrifice for the good of his family despite the toll that the mocking and chaos within his estranged familiar unit takes on him.
