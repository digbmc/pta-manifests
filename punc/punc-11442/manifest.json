Finding little value in the traditional family unit, Egan and Lena create a transient experience of home, as Egan’s air miles allow him to travel everywhere Lena’s work takes her\" (Avery, <i>Unhomely Cinema</i>, 76).</p>"}],"target":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-11442/canvas/1#xywh=63,142,953,798"}]}]}]}
