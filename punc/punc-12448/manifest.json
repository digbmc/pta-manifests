He is both literally and metaphorically leaving them behind: he now knows what he wants and does not want a way out like in the many social situations where he reluctantly participated or avoided earlier in the film. Even a few seconds later, as he opens the door, three exit signs line up on top of the door frames he crosses—he is going in the opposite direction. He also no longer wants to escape the extortion at the hands of the Mattress Man's ring—he put an end to that situation as decisively as he runs to Lena's door. Her love is both the catalyst and motivator for his decisiveness and newfound strength.</p>"}],"target":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-12448/canvas/1#xywh=1358,171,230,192"}]}]}]}
