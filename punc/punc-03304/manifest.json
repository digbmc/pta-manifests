As Jason Sperb writes, “Anderson’s collaboration with Sandler and Revolution echoed his prior agreement with Cruise and New Line—as long as the box-office star remained onboard with the project, Anderson was creatively free to do whatever he wanted. And yet, Anderson remained very much a kind of hired hand with the movie studio—he was brought in by Revolution to shepherd an ‘Adam Sandler film.’ It would be the closest yet that Anderson had come to being an old-fashioned studio auteur—the kind of filmmaker who chooses to work within preexisting genre confines and expectations of something like Sandler’s frat-boy mode of comedy” (Sperb, <i>Blossoms &amp; Blood</i>, 164).</p>"}],"target":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-03304/canvas/1#xywh=365,141,699,570"}]}]}]}
