It is a cavernous space—his sanctuary, his Fortress of Solitude—with all the potential to be filled with emotion and passion. His blue suit, purchased only recently, the viewer will soon learn, makes him blend into the blue paint as if he is simply a decoration. He is easy to ignore. Additionally, this shot frames Barry off center, visually indicating he is strange and a bit \"off.\" He is facing the left side of the frame, with little breathing room in terms of the shot's composition, which suggests a character who is trapped or constrained, as we will soon discover in the film's following scenes.</p><p></p><p>The film introduces Barry to us through an act of mediated communication (speaking on the telephone), since he is not a fluid communicator and has trouble relating to others, so the phone serves as a way to establish both his desire to deeply connect and his inability to do so.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>His first words are \"Yes, I am still on hold,\" which adequately encapsulate Barry before he meets Lena: he is isolated, lonely, and closed to the outside world.
