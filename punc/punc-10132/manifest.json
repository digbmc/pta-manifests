The lyrics describe Barry and Lena perfectly: “Maybe it’s because he's so alone / Maybe it's because he’s never had a home.” Barry, of course, suffers from a deep loneliness, and he is, in fact, attempting to build a home, a domestic space for himself, as emblematized by the blue dollhouse seen in his sister's own house. Lena has decided to make Barry hers, and there’s no stopping her love. There are several similarities between the films: Olive Oyl’s and Lena’s iconic red dresses, Barry’s and Popeye’s seemingly superhuman strength and blue/white sailor color theme. As has been noted many times, Altman is one of PTA’s major influences, and the two directors developed a friendship toward the end of Altman’s life. In Mitchell Zuckoff’s <i>Robert Altman: The Oral Biography</i>, PTA says, “I showed [Altman] <i>Punch-Drunk Love</i> here at my house. There were two chairs, and he was sitting in one and I was sitting in the other. I was just waiting for ‘He Needs Me’—the song Olive sings in <i>Popeye</i>—which I used in my film. I didn’t tell him it was in the film, you know? And right when the music starts [/i laughs], he started conducting [/i waves his arms]. By the end of it he’s applauding—‘Yay!’” (251).</p>"}],"target":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-10132/canvas/1#xywh=728,239,426,403"}]}]}]}
