In this portrait, the only photograph fully in view, Barry strangely appears to be wearing the same blue suit that he only recently bought. Details such as this one and the injuries on his knuckles that spell out “LOVE” after he punches the map on his office wall puncture the film’s sense of verisimilitude. These two scenes, incidentally, share another connection: the American flag’s red, white, and blue encircle Barry in the form of the balloons on his left and the blue dollhouse on his right wrapped in plastic. With his conflicted and sometimes violent emotional core, Barry has trouble fitting into traditional models of domesticity, despite his desire for love.&nbsp;</p>"}],"target":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-01853/canvas/1#xywh=1406,336,126,161"}]}]}]}
