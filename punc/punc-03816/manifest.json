Paul was unsure at the beginning about the tone and where we were going to be, and quite how he would express what he was going to do. There was lot of unsureness and experimentation at the beginning, which was quite tense. In a sense I had to be like Lena and say, ‘That’s fine, don’t worry, I understand what you are going to do’. And it’s because of that experience that we’ve become good friends\" (Dawson).</p>"}],"target":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-03816/canvas/1#xywh=416,278,297,315"}]}]}]}
