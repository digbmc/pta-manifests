How he reaches Utah is never explained; given that in the next scene he walks straight up to the entrance of the mattress store, it wouldn't be unreasonable to think that he even traveled by foot. Additionally, this color interlude functions somewhat differently than the rest in the ways it freezes the image of Barry and how it moves. All of them, however, provide affective and emotional content. In this sense, Brian Price writes, “what one witnesses in Punch Drunk Love is a series of color abstractions that not only interrupt the narrative, but threaten the legibility of the image, and thus narration, altogether” (Price, \"Color,\" 23).</p>"}],"target":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-12118/canvas/1#xywh=66,79,130,124"}]}]}]}
