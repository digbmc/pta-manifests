This framing mediates the spectator’s view through the vertical gaps of their handles, which initially creates distance from the characters. As the camera moves, the plunger handles are no longer in the foreground, gaining the spectator access to the tense atmosphere of the scene about to take place. In other words, the camera resituates the spectator from the position of voyeur to active participant. This shift emphasizes Lena and Elizabeth’s physical entrance into the warehouse, which sets in motion Barry and Lena’s metaphorical entrance into a relationship.</p>"}],"target":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-03441/canvas/1#xywh=632,208,1133,154"},{"id":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-03441/canvas/1/22196e38-b2db-4691-b36c-85cd7f805135","type":"Annotation","motivation":"commenting","body":[{"created":"2025-08-19T20:00:56.857Z","creator":"Olivia Flores","purpose":"commenting","type":"TextualBody","format":"text/html","value":"<p>Elizabeth and Lena enter the warehouse through a blue lens flare.
