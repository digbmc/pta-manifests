During a take, the front of the camera bumped into a table and knocked the camera briefly, causing the shot to jump from Sandler to an image of an out-of-focus piece of the set and then quickly re-adjust. 'Most directors would probably not even print that take,' says Elswit, 'but Paul loved the effect and wanted to do it again. So we did more takes and right at the same point in the dialog, I'd sort of smack the front of the matte box to re-create the look.' Though a final cut wasn't completed by press time, Elswit believes the shot, for which no other coverage exists, will remain in the final film\" (\"Interview: Behind The Scenes With Robert Elswit\").</p>"}],"target":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-02924/canvas/1#xywh=896,538,986,392"},{"id":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-02924/canvas/1/55858537-ebf2-4419-ad72-0cfec4563513","type":"Annotation","motivation":"commenting","body":[{"created":"2025-08-19T17:52:02.265Z","creator":"Olivia Flores","purpose":"commenting","type":"TextualBody","format":"text/html","value":"<p>A number of blue items appear amid the otherwise very drab and colorless setting of Barry’s apartment.
