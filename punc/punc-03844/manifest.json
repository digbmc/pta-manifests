The film is neither a typical Adam Sandler comedy, nor in line with the dynamism of PTA's <em>Boogie Nights</em> and <em>Magnolia</em>. Film critic Ethan Warren has wrestled with his emotions regarding the film quite productively, writing, \"<em>Punch-Drunk Love</em> functions on a very specific level for adolescent boys, one so precise and intense that it’s easier to look away from than to accept. It’s simultaneously an expression of fantasies they don’t dare express, and a bleak realization of their darkest fears\" (\"There’s More to This World\"). His reading of the film has shifted from angry bafflement to an appreciation of how it depicts Barry's stunted development as a man.</p>"}],"target":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-03844/canvas/1#xywh=286,142,653,797"}]}]}]}
