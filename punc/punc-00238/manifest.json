This car flipping over, which is never explained, is the first such situation. It precedes the intrusion of Lena into Barry’s life and the chaos that ensues because of their relationship. During the New York Film Festival audience Q&amp;A, PTA said of the car crash, \"That's just something you write to get going, like, you need something to START. Joel Silver, a guy that, y’know, makes 'those kind of movies', I once heard him say that every movie should start with a BANG, and that just made sense to me\" (<i>Cigarettes &amp; Red Vines</i>, \"Interview: New York Film Festival Q&amp;A\"). In another interview, he compared the car crash, which he acknowledges as somewhat absurd, to a \"big hit song\" played at the beginning of a concert to grab an audience's attention and said that it was just \"to have fun\" (cigsandvines, \"pta on arte-tv discussing pdl (1/3)\").</p>"
