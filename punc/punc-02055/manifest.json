More precisely, shopping is, for Egan, a pleasurable form of work. For what is most striking about these scenes is not only the way the supermarket is imbued with intense colours, as the piles of mass-produced products take on a magical lure, but Egan’s ecstatic reaction to the act of shopping\" (Avery, <em>Unhomely Cinema</em>, 82). This shot of Barry perusing the products and making his choice shows him boxed into refrigerators that externalize his internal state: frozen.
