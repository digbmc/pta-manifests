The viewer doesn’t know.&nbsp;PTA has said that \"movies are 50 percent seeing and 50 percent hearing, and if you don't have one, you're shortchanging the audience\" (Kam, \"Interview: 'Practical Insanity'\"). During an audience Q&amp;A, PTA stated: \"I knew that the first scene in the movie was Barry hearing something off-camera and just how nice it would be to be able to sort of blend the sound effects and the music and kind of making like an experience movie. Like a hippie kind of movie. Really. So kind of like, the first scene he’s gonna hear something and that is where the movie will begin. Just lots of notes and things like good ideas and fucking it up with the sound and kind of coming at an audience with both barrels. We’d done some of that stuff in <i>Magnolia</i> in the very beginning of the movie with some bizarre sound design stuff. It's just really fun and exciting to do and made sense. I was keeping on with those ideas that seemed to fit the story and kind of to help electrify it all up a little bit. A nice experience of making the movie and editing the movie and working with Pro Tools and working with the Avid and working with Jon Brion in the next room and sort of get a good group of people together. That becomes a real fun part of the job is making all the sound and doing all that kind of stuff and you’re still blending it into the work\" (\"Interview: BAM Q&amp;A\").</p><p></p><p>Even though Barry stands as he disconnects from the call, this action does not confer him with agency. He is in the corner of the room, with dim artificial light, and unable to communicate effectively.</p>"
