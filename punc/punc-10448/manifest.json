It's a real interesting experiment in what sound can do to somebody. It was a real parade and there were cameras hidden and no one knew what was going on. We did a few takes and it was kinda not that great. It was sort of the first time that Adam was not like hitting it. And I thought maybe it was all this craziness [the parade] and everything else. Then this amazing thing happened with the take that's in the movie. Far down the street, there was these tribal drums. It was a Japanese day parade, a celebration of a Japanese holiday. So there these tribal drums down the street going 'boom, boom, boom'. That was the take. Because it obviously sort of got inside of Adam's mind and brain and this amazing take happened. But previous to that, the takes that weren't so fantastic had this gentle, wonderful music happening as the parade was marching down the street. So I was thinking after that great take, 'Jesus Christ, let's some [sic] more drums happening'\" (\"Interview: Exclusive Advance Seattle Screening Q&amp;A Transcription\").</p>"}],"target":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-10448/canvas/1#xywh=703,469,190,177"}]}]}]}
