Barry is delighted to finally find someone who understands his passion and the violence that dwells within him, along with his capacity for love and connection. This exchange, of course, is tonally bizarre for the romantic comedy genre, but that, in fact, was PTA's aim: \"'I've always loved the romantic comedy genre, especially Astaire-Rogers movies like 'Carefree' and 'The Gay Divorcee,' but they're a bit out to pasture, they've kind of become standard, like action movies [...] These are dark, confused days for movies; stuff is not working. It's a good opportunity for small revolutions to happen, for filmmakers to feel a responsibility to mix it up a bit'\" (Turan). George Toles suggests that because the blue lens flare \"rhymes so perfectly with [Barry's] clothing, a pulling motion is gently established, menacing Barry with the possibility of sinking, even drowning, in this still lake\" (Toles, <i>Paul Thomas Anderson</i>, 34).</p>"}],"target":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-11008/canvas/1#xywh=1,665,1915,229"}]}]}]}
