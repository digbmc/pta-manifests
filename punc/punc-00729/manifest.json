The largely quiet first few minutes are disrupted only by eerie sounds of trains, car crashes, and Barry’s heavy breathing in the dark. This silence slowly gives way to a more recognizable musical score after the harmonium appears, bringing a soft glow that contrasts with the harsh outdoor light of which Barry seems so afraid” (Sperb, <em>Blossoms &amp; Blood</em>, 170). To build on Sperb's insight, this is an early instance of a pattern in <em>Punch-Drunk Love</em> of a break between the boundaries of the film's inner world and what exists beyond it. In this case, the non-diegetic sounds of the score, as Sperb writes, seem to come from within the instrument, or at least from Barry's first contact with the harmonium. Elsewhere, the attraction that Barry and Lena feel seems to manifest in numerous lens flares. These phenomena suggest that the emotions the characters, particularly Barry, feel exceed the bounds of the film's physical world and manifest beyond it.</p>"}],"target":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-00729/canvas/1#xywh=658,314,445,333"},{"id":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-00729/canvas/1/469e82c0-14e6-42f4-b4a8-9b66428ef4b2","type":"Annotation","motivation":"commenting","body":[{"created":"2025-08-14T19:05:10.064Z","creator":"Olivia Flores","purpose":"commenting","type":"TextualBody","format":"text/html","value":"<p>Lena’s car remains in full view during this sequence, linking her and the instrument once more.</p>"}],"target":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-00729/canvas/1#xywh=1577,572,340,382"},{"id":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-00729/canvas/1/43509477-7735-4baf-aa52-e13a29b52f73","type":"Annotation","motivation":"commenting","body":[{"created":"2025-08-14T19:05:20.553Z","creator":"Olivia Flores","purpose":"commenting","type":"TextualBody","format":"text/html","value":"<p>As he takes the harmonium towards his office, Barry drops the hermetically, tightly sealed cup, leaving it behind.
