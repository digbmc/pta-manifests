Again, an embodied metaphor: “I feel as if I got hit by a truck.” The staging suggests such a collision as the vehicle passes him from right to left. His life will never be the same again. PTA named this emotion in an interview as \"a feeling of being run over by love and not being able to steer it in one direction – not to know how to get control of it again\" (Rehfeld). Note the by-now-familiar blue and red on the sides of the truck. The truck moves from right to left, contrary to how viewers in the US would scan an image (left to right, like we read). This further destabilizes the character, who \"gets hit by a truck.\" Additionally, the moving company's name, Atlas, provides one more layer of significance: in Greek and Roman mythology, the titan Atlas must hold the heavens on his shoulders for eternity. At times, it seems that Barry is doing so as well.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the jarring visual effect of the staging, the sound design departs from naturalism to reinforce the scare. Though the truck can be seen approaching in the previous shot, the world is uncannily silent until the vehicle's roar accompanies its appearance in this shot. The suddenness of the sound has a sublime effect, amplifying the sense of momentary transcendence that characterizes this pivotal moment. As the truck speeds away and its sound fades out, a brief moment of score lingers to echo the magic and mystery before trailing out and leaving only the sounds of Barry running with the piano.</p>"}],"target":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-00705/canvas/1#xywh=972,224,947,547"}]}]}]}
