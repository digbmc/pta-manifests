During an audience Q&amp;A, Philip Seymour Hoffman said, \"I understood pretty quickly why we had to [redo the scene]. I was like, yeah, he should be the one acting up on me. He should be the one winning back the girl. He’s gotta go get rid of his demons. He’s gotta face his dark side. So I kind of look at my part in the film as, for lack of a less pretentious word, a mythical type of character. It’s like a part of a person. It’s like I’m part of him and I’m there saying one thing and he’s gotta get rid of me. Whether Paul sees that or not is not important to me as an actor\" (\"Interview: BAM Q&amp;A\").</p>"}],"target":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-12232/canvas/1#xywh=6,142,1262,794"}]}]}]}
