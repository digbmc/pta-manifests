It precedes the green of the 7UP display at the grocery store and the green wall in the hospital's emergency room. The choice of green is a canny use of color theory. Within one model of color theory, the primary colors are red, blue, and yellow. Combinations of these colors produce the secondary colors: orange (red and yellow), purple (blue and red), and green (blue and yellow). Green is the only secondary color that does not contain red. Indeed, because red and green are opposite each other on the color wheel, they are considered complementary, providing the strongest perceptual contrast against each other. In the context of <i>Punch-Drunk Love</i>, green acts as the most oppositional color to Lena's red.</p>"}],"target":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-01844/canvas/1#xywh=389,241,310,292"},{"id":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-01844/canvas/1/9d4db964-fe34-4893-b183-1ae7536ac8bc","type":"Annotation","motivation":"commenting","body":[{"created":"2025-08-15T19:07:42.206Z","creator":"Olivia Flores","purpose":"commenting","type":"TextualBody","format":"text/html","value":"<p>An evocation of The Last Supper.
