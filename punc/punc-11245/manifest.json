Scorsese's film explores loneliness and masculinity in a large city and features violent outbursts. In this scene, Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) deals with rejection and a descent into desperation, which contrasts with Barry taking control of his life. Yet, his voice also has some of the despair we hear in <em>Taxi Driver</em>'s call.</p>"}],"target":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-11245/canvas/1#xywh=656,139,618,799"}]}]}]}
