The entire film may be summed up as his attempts to put his life in order, symbolized through the harmonium that he tapes to fix.</p><p></p><p>During this conversation Barry also speaks fondly of his favorite morning show featuring “DJ Justice.” Barry may be impulsive and frequently lie, but he is motivated by a strong sense of justice. This virtue will take hold when he attacks the Mattress Man’s henchmen after they crash their truck into Barry’s car.</p><p></p><p>It's also noteworthy that he says, “I laugh and laugh even when I’m alone\"—another instance of his deep loneliness.</p>"}],"target":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-04328/canvas/1#xywh=640,135,602,709"}]}]}]}
