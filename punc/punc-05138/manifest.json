There's no reference to her recently moving, nor is there any obvious reason why she would have these boxes. Instead, the film's complex of images and references are deeply concentrated and constantly recur. Lena has forced Barry out of his shell which is, in a sense, a relocation. He will later travel to Hawaii to see her, which reinforces the running theme of their love  as a potential for escape and \"relocation\" from their own fraught lives, and from the loneliness epidemic that is so prevalent in the United States.</p>"}],"target":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-05138/canvas/1#xywh=0,425,264,392"}]}]}]}
