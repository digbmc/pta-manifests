The scene was shot at Eckhart Auto Body at 10101 Canoga Avenue in the northwest side of the city. The urban sprawl of LA grants the film some of the sense of desolation and despair that plagues Barry. Here, the forested mountains loom in the background as a natural escape from the concrete and fences. Barry and Lena’s love will only come into full bloom—and be consummated—amid the natural splendor of Hawaii. As we were beginning this project, a series of wildfires devastated the Los Angeles landscape and displaced many families who lived near the foci of this natural disaster. When paired with the sadness and desolation that the film portrays, this eerie coincidence only deepened the effect that the location has on the story central to <i>Punch-Drunk Love</i>.</p><p></p><p>PTA is cautious about assigning too much meaning to his films, however, as in this fragment from an audience Q&amp;A: \"To me, it’s first and foremost from the character. From Barry’s stomach and from who he is and the situation that he’s in. Someone I can relate to. Anything that comes out of that, those are the discoveries that I make after writing the movie. I never have a real big social picture in my mind. I just feel like it would be an Oliver Stone movie. Y’know. Like, I really gotta say something about man versus machine. I really gotta get to the bottom of that (Audience Laughs). I dunno. I mean, I think I know I was obviously kind of lonely and horny and called a phone sex-line\" (\"Interview: BAM Q&amp;A\").</p><p></p><p>The blue/white motif from inside the warehouse is repeated externally through the blue sky and white building.</p>"}],"target":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-00645/canvas/1#xywh=698,273,1219,408"}]}]}]}
