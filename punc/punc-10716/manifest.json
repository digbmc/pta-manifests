Other hotel guests cross the lobby until only the pair is left hugging, their bodies creating a heart shape of blue sky between them. Barry finds peace as the crowd passes by, leaving them alone in paradise. The blue of the ocean and pale red of the wall behind Barry and Lena keep their colors present even as they are backlit. This hallway is iconic for its ability to remain dark and silhouette people who stand in it while showing a perfectly lit background in the daytime. Again, light and dark coexist within Barry, but with Lena, there is about to be a lot more light.</p>"}],"target":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-10716/canvas/1#xywh=536,177,871,712"}]}]}]}
