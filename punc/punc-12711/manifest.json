Like the scene in which Barry picks up the harmonium leading to the introduction of Brion's score, here the diegetic and non-diegetic levels intersect, suggesting that Barry and Lena's love overflows beyond the limits of the film. There is, in fact, no harmonium in the score itself, much to the disappointment of composer Jon Brion (Movie List, \"Jon Brion on working with Paul Thomas Anderson and scoring Punch-Drunk Love\").</p>"}],"target":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-12711/canvas/1#xywh=587,344,858,593"}]}]}]}
