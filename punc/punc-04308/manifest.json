'It was perfect,' recalled Anderson — 'a guy with all these sisters being chased by four brothers'\" (MacDonald). PTA himself has said, \"The four brothers are from Utah. They were Mormon. They were great guys. Originally the part had been written for two guys. I always kind of thought that was wrong. I talked to my casting director, Cassandra, who is wonderful and said, 'Why don't we go to Utah and look for some people that might be good for this?' She came and said 'I found this guy.' I said, 'Yeah, he looks interesting.' She said, 'and he's got three brothers'. I thought how exciting to have the concept of a guy with seven sisters with four brothers coming after him. That was really exciting. They came down to Los Angeles. We were already shooting at that point. And with one look at the four Stevens Brothers and you'd be a fool not to hire them. They're great dudes, great great dudes\" (\"Interview: Exclusive Advance Seattle Screening Q&amp;A Transcription\").</p>"}],"target":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-04308/canvas/1#xywh=647,195,1038,744"},{"id":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-04308/canvas/1/8c72be45-471f-4d0f-8d5b-97cb211c7980","type":"Annotation","motivation":"commenting","body":[{"created":"2025-08-20T21:17:30.234Z","creator":"Olivia Flores","purpose":"commenting","type":"TextualBody","format":"text/html","value":"<p>The Asteroid arcade game that sits in the corner of the Mattress Man's office establishes the alien abduction theme associated with the brothers, who will soon kidnap Barry in a scene shot with curious lighting as if a UFO hangs over their truck.</p>"}],"target":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-04308/canvas/1#xywh=852,296,204,116"}]}]}]}
