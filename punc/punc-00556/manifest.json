[PTA] asked if we could meet, and we went to his favorite diner in the Valley. He said he was interested in making a 90-minute romantic comedy. I said, 'Well, I don’t want to die or cry,' because I’d done quite a lot of that. He sent me the script, and I sat down and watched all of Adam’s movies, then had this nice thought that, somewhere in Hollywood, Adam was watching <i>Breaking the Waves</i>\" (McHenry). On her character, she said, \"This character wasn’t really a real person; she was a kind of cipher, an alien. Her name is Lena, which means light. She’s just a light going on\" (McHenry). As Lena looks over her shoulder, the harmonium is in the background; this shot visually links the instrument and the character, much as the eyeline match between Lena and Barry connects them.</p>"
