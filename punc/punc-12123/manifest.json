As this shift occurs just before Barry's confrontation with the Mattress Man, it signifies the strength that Barry feels, as he soon says in the store's backroom, because of the love he now has in his life. Barry's blue and Lena's red, in other words, cover the Mattress Man, defeating him. The interludes have thematic resonances, but they also served practical purposes according to PTA: \"There's three of them. One's at the beginning of the movie. There's a second one in the middle of the movie because I had to cut something out. And I thought, 'I got just the thing to put there!' It was like making music. You know, this could really use a guitar solo. And the third was toward the end when I was trying to figure out how to teleport somebody to another place\" (Morris).</p>"}],"target":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-12123/canvas/1#xywh=62,85,116,111"}]}]}]}
