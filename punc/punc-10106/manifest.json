Harry Powell, the serial murderer and false reverend played by Robert Mitchum, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" class=\"text-blue-500 underline hover:text-blue-600\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcTv-BEwabk\">gives a speech about the divine powers of love battling the powers of evil</a>, illustrating the struggle through the \"LOVE\" and \"HATE\" tattoos adoring the knuckles of each hand. The scene has another famous citation. In Spike Lee's 1989 film <i>Do the Right Thing</i>, Bed-Stuy resident Radio Raheem, played by Bill Nunn, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" class=\"text-blue-500 underline hover:text-blue-600\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC6gI4gXYPw\">reinterprets the speech using \"LOVE\" and \"HATE\" brass knuckles</a>, transforming Powell's insincere explication to an assertion of a Black man's liberatory dreams in a world constituted by antiblack racism. Here, PTA only depicts, if obliquely, the word \"LOVE,\" suggesting a shift in Barry towards the possibilities of loveâ€”not, this case, cosmic, but for both himself and another.</p>"}],"target":"https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/pta/punc/punc-10106/canvas/1#xywh=694,728,313,100"}]}]}]}
